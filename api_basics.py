# ============================================================

# an API is a way for one program to communicate with another program.
# API means application programming interface.

# a chatbot is a program that talks with the user.
# in this project, the chatbot asks the api for data.

# simple flow:
# user -> chatbot -> api -> data
# data -> api -> chatbot -> user

# fastapi is a python framework for building apis.
# uvicorn is the server that runs the fastapi app.

from fastapi import FastAPI


# ============================================================
# 1. create the api app
# ============================================================

# app is the main fastapi object.
# uvicorn will run this object.

app = FastAPI()

# ============================================================
# 2. sample data
# ============================================================

# this dictionary stores student enrollment data.
# the key is the year.
# the value is the number of students.

data = {
    2024: 1700,
    2025: 1650,
    2026: 1800
}


# ============================================================
# 3. home endpoint
# ============================================================

# @app.get("/") creates a get endpoint.
# get means the client wants to read data.
# "/" is the home path.
# when the user opens http://127.0.0.1:8000/
# this function runs.

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "api is running"}


# ============================================================
# 4. get all enrollment data
# ============================================================

# this endpoint returns the whole dictionary.

@app.get("/students")
def get_all_students():
    return data


# ============================================================
# 5. get enrollment by year
# ============================================================

# this endpoint receives a year from the user.
# example:
# http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/enrollment?year=2025

# year: int means fastapi expects year to be an integer.
# data.get(year) safely looks for the year in the dictionary.
# if the year does not exist, it returns none.

@app.get("/students/enrollment")
def get_enrollment(year: int):

    students = data.get(year)

    if students is None:
        return {
            "year": year,
            "error": "no data for this year"
        }

    return {
        "year": year,
        "students": students
    }


# ============================================================
# 6. post example
# ============================================================

# post means create new data.
# this endpoint receives json data from the client.
# example json:
# {
#     "year": 2027,
#     "students": 1900
# }

@app.post("/students/enrollment")
def add_enrollment(item: dict):

    year     = item.get("year")
    students = item.get("students")

    if year is None or students is None:
        return {"error": "please provide year and students"}

    data[year] = students

    return {
        "message": "new enrollment added",
        "data": data
    }


# ============================================================
# 7. put example
# ============================================================

# put means update existing data.
# this endpoint updates the number of students for a year.

@app.put("/students/enrollment/{year}")
def update_enrollment(year: int, item: dict):

    students = item.get("students")

    if students is None:
        return {"error": "please provide students"}

    if year not in data:
        return {"error": "year not found"}

    data[year] = students

    return {
        "message": "enrollment updated",
        "year": year,
        "students": students
    }


# ============================================================
# 8. delete example
# ============================================================

# delete means remove data.
# this endpoint removes one year from the dictionary.

@app.delete("/students/enrollment/{year}")
def delete_enrollment(year: int):

    if year not in data:
        return {"error": "year not found"}

    removed_value = data.pop(year)

    return {
        "message": "enrollment deleted",
        "year": year,
        "students": removed_value
    }


# ============================================================
# 9. how to run this api
# ============================================================

# in terminal, run:
# uvicorn api_chatbot:app --reload

# meaning:
# api_chatbot = this is our file name without .py
# app         = the fastapi object
# --reload    = restart automatically after code changes

# then open:
# http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

# /docs gives an automatic testing page.


# ============================================================
# summary
# ============================================================

# api        -> communication system between programs
# request    -> question sent to the api
# response   -> answer returned by the api
# endpoint   -> url path such as /students
# json       -> common data format for api responses
# get        -> read data
# post       -> create data
# put        -> update data
# delete     -> remove data
# fastapi    -> python tool for building apis
# uvicorn    -> server that runs the api


# ============================================================
# chatbot beginner notes
# file name: chatbot.py
# ============================================================

# this chatbot asks the user a question.
# it finds the year in the question.
# then it sends that year to the api.
# then it prints the api answer.

# the api must be running before this chatbot runs.

import requests


# ============================================================
# 1. api url
# ============================================================

# this is the endpoint from api_chatbot.py.
# the chatbot will send requests to this address.

api_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/enrollment"


# ============================================================
# 2. ask api function
# ============================================================

# this function sends a year to the api.
# params={"year": year} creates this kind of url:
# http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/enrollment?year=2025

def ask_api(year):

    response = requests.get(
        api_url,
        params={"year": year}

    return response.json()


# ============================================================
# 3. get user question
# ============================================================

# input() asks the user to type something.

question = input("ask me: ")


# ============================================================
# 4. find the year in the question
# ============================================================

# start with no year.
# then check each word in the question.
# if a word is a number, convert it to integer.

year = None

for word in question.split():

    word = word.replace("?", "")
    word = word.replace(".", "")
    word = word.replace(",", "")

    if word.isdigit():
        year = int(word)


# ============================================================
# 5. handle missing year
# ============================================================

# if the user does not write a year, the chatbot cannot ask the api.

if year is None:
    print("please include a year.")


# ============================================================
# 6. ask api and print answer
# ============================================================

else:
    result = ask_api(year)

    if result.get("students") is not None:
        print(f"{result['students']} students enrolled in {result['year']}.")

    else:
        print(result["error"])


# ============================================================
# 7. how to run everything
# ============================================================

# open terminal 1 and run:
# uvicorn api_chatbot:app --reload

# keep terminal 1 running.

# open terminal 2 and run:
# python chatbot.py

# example question:
# how many students in 2025?

# expected answer:
# 1650 students enrolled in 2025.


# ============================================================
# summary
# ============================================================

# chatbot    -> talks with the user
# api        -> gives data
# requests   -> python library for calling apis
# params     -> data sent to the api
# .json()    -> converts api response into python dictionary
# input()    -> receives user text
# split()    -> breaks text into words
# isdigit()  -> checks whether text is a number
